> _A comprehensive Building Management System for efficient facility operations and maintenance._

## 📋 Overview

The E-Building System Management Application is a sophisticated software solution designed to revolutionize the management and maintenance of buildings and their associated assets. Specifically developed for the FST (Faculty of Science and Technology) building, this system aims to enhance operational efficiency, effectiveness, and reliability while ensuring optimal comfort and safety for all occupants.

This comprehensive building management platform serves as a centralized hub for various stakeholders, including building management personnel, supervisors, administrative staff, and service providers. By integrating multiple aspects of building operations into a unified system, E-Building eliminates redundant processes, reduces manual workload, and provides real-time insights for data-driven decision-making.

## 🎯 Project Vision
